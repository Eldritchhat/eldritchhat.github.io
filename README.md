# Hegelian Hole
### Working in the website mines over here pal!

Hegelian Hole is a blog/repository for all the dumb junk I make. For a while I have hosted this on Tumblr, now I will at least try to code it in GitHub.

If you wish to help, or give advice, you can. However, I know I am somewhat of a lost college.
